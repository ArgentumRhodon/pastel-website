        <h1>Devlog 4: MAGIC & More</h1>
        <h2>MAGIC Maker Application</h2>
        <p>
          It’s been really fun seeing our basic systems and improvements
          culminating in an actual game that people have fun with. We’ve decided
          that, although the application itself is a requirement of the class in
          which this project is being developed, we would like to apply for and
          pursue the
          <a href="https://www.rit.edu/simonecenter/magic-maker-program"
            >MAGIC Maker Program</a
          >, which provides students with some funding and support for the
          development of their digital media projects at a prototyping,
          production, or publishing level.
        </p>
        <p>
          If approved, Team Pastel would go into the prototyping phase, further
          polishing and iterating on our game until we found a good balance and
          feel. We feel prototyping would be best at this stage because of the
          big changes our overall level layouts and mechanics are seeing.
          Production would be best for the content generation that comes after
          our prototype feels solid.
        </p>
        <h2>Two Sprints Left!</h2>
        <p>
          Seeing our game come together in a more formal sense with the MAGIC
          Maker application was rewarding. With our core gameplay features
          solidified and only two sprints remaining, we’ve decided to move on to
          polishing existing facets of the game and iterating and expanding on
          our level designs. Although Mixbox is an excellent tool that saved us
          a lot of development time, its color outputs are only an
          approximation, meaning some shades of yellow and blue work better than
          others for creating an appealing green. So, in the interest of polish,
          a web tool for fine-tuning color palettes was developed. Our level
          designer made use of this tool to find colors that would create easily
          distinguishable shades and mixes while also maximizing the aesthetic
          appeal.
        </p>
        <h2>Identity to Community</h2>
        <img src="../imgs/comm.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          As part of our process, we expected and were prepared for things to
          change. But we didn’t expect just how constantly our game would morph
          into what it’s become. Our second playtest rendered feedback
          suggesting our game lent itself more toward helping and valuing
          community and others than discovering one’s own identity. Given this
          shift, our experience goal of instilling pastel emotions also shifted
          to a more wholesome theme, and our target audience expanded to include
          both college students and those with familial and community-focused
          values.
