        <h1>Devlog 2: Getting Going</h1>
        <h2>What Can the Player Do?</h2>
        <p>
          With the theme of discovering identity, we were left to decide what
          player abilities would lend themselves to the discovery of identity
          and exploring the unknown. Our decided mechanic was the splitting and
          merging of the player, aka “Refracting” and “Merging,” as a prismatic
          entity. The idea being as if you had to leave pieces of yourself, or
          discover new ones, to traverse the level.
        </p>
        <h2>The Heartbeat of the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The first question we asked ourselves after establishing a team,
          project expectations, and our target audience was “what is the player
          going to do?” We had a type of experience in mind, but what core
          interactions would support our gameplay? How would it support our
          theme of discovering identity?
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing on discovery, one often reveals aspects of their identity
          through the choices they make. So, we wanted a core gameplay loop
          (CGL) that encourages discovery and decision making through important
          decisions with consequences. Hence we came up with the CGL below,
          clockwise starting at Analyze:
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/cgl.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The player would analyze their environment, decide how to traverse the
          area, and then do so through the main mechanics.
