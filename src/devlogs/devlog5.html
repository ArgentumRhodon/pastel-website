        <h2>Third Playtest & Level Rework</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted our third playtest during this phase, focusing on the
          reworked level design. Initially, our levels were linear, focusing on
          guiding player progression. However, we found that this linearity was
          a bit stifling and didn’t fit our new community-centered theme very
          well. So we devised a new level design, with a community center for
          rescued slimes and levels that spoke out from the community center.
        </p>
        <p>
          This design, however, confused playtesters more than it was worth for
          our theme, so we revisited a linear format, making sure to use clearer
          design that focuses both on guided progression and intermittent
          challenge for a better experience. Our level designer learned that
          levels for our game should be made only as big as it needs to be to
          progress the player in the amount intended. Otherwise it feels
          troublesome to navigate, wasting the player's time.
        </p>
        <h2>EDGE Showcase</h2>
        <p>
          We showcased our game at the Experiential Development & Games Expo (<a
            href="https://www.rit.edu/computing/school-interactive-games-and-media/edge"
            >EDGE</a
          >) hosted by the School of Interactive Games and Media (IGM)! Overall
          it went well, with many playtesters enjoying the game and
          understanding how to progress. Our main issue for EDGE was in the
          preparation for it. Although we ran through the game and made a build
          beforehand, we ran into a number of issues during setup, resulting in
          approximately 16 extra builds, with the last one being done shortly
          after the event started. From this, we know to more thoroughly test
          our builds the day before, going beyond a cursory glance through. We
          were lucky enough that it didn’t get in the way of the event this
          time, but you can’t rely on that.
        </p>
        <h2>An Unexpected Change</h2>
        <p>
          One of our more unexpected changes was to cut the player’s ability to
          fall. During playtests, players would attempt to fall (e.g., from a
          ledge) and get stuck on the level’s geometry. Since the level design
          didn’t necessitate falling and it caused more issues than it solved,
          we removed the ability to fall. We saw a noticeable improvement in
          playability during playtests after. If gameplay doesn’t quite feel
          right, closely inspect if some of your naturally assumed mechanics are
          really necessary (and whether cutting them out is worth the player’s
          shock/disappointment when they find they can’t do it).
        </p>
        <h2>Team Bonding</h2>

        <p>
          Amidst the intense development cycle, Team Pastel took a refreshing
          break with a morning diner visit, which served as a nice pause that
          reminded us of the importance of team camaraderie beyond project
          development.
