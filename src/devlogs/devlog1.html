        <h1>Devlog 1: Pre-Class Discussions</h1>
        <h2>A New World</h2>
        <p>
          In the beginning, there was only darkness. But then there wasn’t, and
          what would become Team Pastel began its long journey, chopping and
          stomping and slowly navigating their way through the darkness in an
          attempt to bring light, meaning, and emotion – and, soon enough,
          slimes – to this dark world. Our first step along this path was
          answering the question of “What do we want?”
        </p>
        <h2>Establishing Expectations</h2>
        <img src="../imgs/goals.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          As game developers, it's important to establish what we want out of
          our projects. Answering questions like: What are our individual goals
          for this project? What do we want going in? What do we want coming
          out? Are there certain skills we wish to improve? What does the team
          as a whole want for the project? What sorts of priorities do we have?
          Answering these questions helps the team set an initial approach to
          the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our initial meeting broadly answered these questions on a team and
          individual basis. For brevity, individual goals will be withheld, but
          our team’s Core Ideals were established as such: The project should be
          challenging enough to keep members engaged and passionate about the
          project, but our approach and process should utilize limited meetings
          and regular code freezes to keep crunch to a minimum. Our method
          should also follow lean practices, only adding processes to solve
          active problems.
        </p>
        <h2>Targeting an Audience</h2>
        <img src="../imgs/targetAudience.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Once general project expectations have been set, ideation begins! What
          do we want in our dark world? Who do we want to see what we’ve
          discovered? What makes them interested? How will it affect them? Our
          next meeting focused on answering these questions at least a little
          bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          When considering who you want to target, it's important to think about
          what audiences are accessible to your team. Making sure your target
          audience is an accessible resource for playtesting ensures that you
          can make accurately informed decisions on what turns to take during
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          After extensive consideration defining experience goals, demographics,
          themes meaningful to the team, and more, we landed on a theme of
          discovering identity and the personal process and emotions involved.
          We found a target audience of college students to best fit our
          requirement for relevance to the theme and ease of access for
          playtests.
        </p>
        <h2>That’s It!</h2>
        <p>
          This concludes the first devlog, in which we explored our opening
          strategy for exploring a dark unknown world: establishing team
          expectations, target theme, and target audience.
