        <h1>Devlog 3: Slime Time</h1>
        <h2>The Player Character</h2>
        <p>
          We explored 21 different player character concepts drafted up by our
          artist, culminating in the selection of our charming slime as the
          central character design. We chose the slime due to the relative
          simplicity of rigging and overall cuteness, and we think plushies are
          definitely in order.

        <h2>Real Color Mixing</h2>
        <p>
          Since our game relies on colors to convey the player’s state, and
          importantly the mixing of those colors in a natural environment, we
          felt the colors should mix in an equally natural way. This posed one
          of our first technical challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate why, consider the linear interpolation between yellow
          and blue: yellow’s RGB values are [1, 1, 0]; blue’s RGB values are [0,
          0, 1]; mix them together evenly and you end up with [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
          which is the RGB value for gray. Mixing pigments in the real world
          would make a green, not gray!
        </p>
        <p>
          As a quick and effective solution to our problem, we found
          <a href="https://scrtwpns.com/mixbox/">Mixbox</a> by Scrtwpns (check
          out their online tech demo). Mixbox is a black box solution to
          inputting RGB values and getting a simulated real-world pigment in RGB
          out (i.e., yellow + blue → Mixbox → green). Using their Unity package,
          we developed the HueMix class, which is capable of representing a
          store of component colors and a resultant output color, allowing us to
          remove and add one color at a time for cool combinations on the fly!

        <h2>Levels & Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          The development of a variety of levels allowed us to showcase our
          progress during playtests. Player feedback highlighted the need for
          improved camera controls and more effective onboarding strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also gained a valuable piece of insight from this round of
          playtesting. We didn’t notice our camera was y-inverted until the
          major playtest, so everyone was commenting on something that could’ve
          been an easy fix, taking attention away from more important parts of
          the game. The insight we gathered is that we should get some light
          external feedback before a major playtest to catch some of the smaller
          issues the team may be blind to. This way playtesters during the
          larger playtest can focus on other parts of the game.
